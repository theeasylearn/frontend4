---------------------
 CSS
---------------------

The theme stylesheet is css/style.default.css. If you want to make any changes,
you can do it here or better to override it in custom.css so you can update the original theme stylesheet if an updated is released.
Changing to another colour variant, is just a matter of replacing css/style.default.css with css/style.pink.css in index.html.

**Changing logo**

There are two versions of logo used in the template - full logo `logo.png, 187px x 47px` used on higher resolution devices and small logo `logo-small.png, 110px x 47px` used on mobile phones only. When changing the logo please respect the height of the image (i.e. it should have 47px). Some testing and maybe also adjustments in the css would be needed if you use logo of radically different proportions than the one used in the template. 


**Changing the colour of the theme**

Every colour variant has its appropriate stylesheets located in the /css directory. To change the colour of the template simply change the path in the header of the HTML template, i.e. from `style.default.css` to `style.pink.css`.

---------------------
 JavaScript
---------------------

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/theme.js. In this file you can change the settings of the owl carousel, product detail image switch etc.
